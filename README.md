# Project Overview

People increasingly agree that national progress cannot be judged by economic output alone; a fuller picture comes from understanding how citizens actually feel about their lives. The World Happiness Index offers that broader lens, ranking countries by self-reported life satisfaction. Yet the score itself is only the surface. Behind it lie economic resources, the strength of social ties, personal health, individual freedoms, civic generosity, trust in institutions, and security in the labour market. Exploring how each of these factors relates to happiness is therefore essential for explaining why some societies thrive while others struggle.


## Motivation

Global “happiness scores" are now widely used by governments and NGOs as a shorthand for quality of life, yet the drivers of national well being are still debated. By combining the latest World Happiness Report data with basic labour market information (unemployment rates) we aim to quantify which socioeconomic factors most strongly track a country’s average life satisfaction and highlight levers that policy makers can realistically pull.


## Dataset

Dataset includes 135 countries, 10 variables: 
- Happiness score (target)
- GDP per capita
- Social support
- Healthy life expectancy
- Freedom of choice
- Generosity
- Perceived corruption
- Unemployment rate
